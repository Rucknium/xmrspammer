# xmrspammer

`xmrspammer` is an alpha project. Expect breaking changes in future
versions.

## Installation

Install R. Linux users should install the `r-base` and `r-base-dev`
system packages.

You can install the development version of `xmrspammer` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/Rucknium/xmrspammer) if you have `git` and
`curl` installed on your system with:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Rucknium/xmrspammer", upgrade = FALSE)
```

## ❗❗❗ WARNING: Wallets not secure

`xmrspammer` is intended to be used with valueless testnet coins. The
security of the wallet creation and management processes have not been
evaluated. If you use `xmrspammer` on mainnet, your coins could be
stolen.

## Design

The Monero protocol has a few restrictions that make transaction
spamming more difficult than, say, bitcoin.

First is the 16-output limit. The maximum number of outputs that a
Monero transaction can have is 16. A single output cannot be as easily
split into a very large number of outputs due to this restriction.

Second is the 10-block lock. Wallets must wait 10 confirmations to spend
new outputs.

A third factor in stressnet testing is the need to fill the stressnet
txpool to test node performance when the txpool is large. Transactions
cannot be chained together in the txpool (i.e. child transactions cannot
spend unconfirmed parent outputs). A wallet needs to have many outputs
available to spend so that many of its unconfirmed transactions can wait
in the txpool.

The design of `xmrspammer` works around these limitations. Wallets are
set up to expand a single output into a “tree”. At the end of the
process, a wallet will have many “leaves” that contain a single output
within an account. From there, the default spamming procedure iterates
through each leaf, creating a self-spend transaction back to each leaf.

`xmrspammer` creates a user-specified number of wallets and boots a
`monero-wallet-rpc` process for each wallet. A `monerod` Monero node
process must be available on the local machine (TODO: allow remote
nodes). For each wallet, `xmrspammer` spawns an R process that runs a
spamming loop. The loop instructs each `monero-wallet-rpc` process to
create and broadcast transactions as quickly as possible.

## Usage

`xmrspammer` has only been tested on Linux.

Users should view coins put into the spamming wallets as unrecoverable.
Large amounts of coins should not be put into single spamming wallets
because wallets with hundreds of thousands of transactions become slow
to produce new transactions. At that point, the wallets should be
abandoned and fresh wallets created. TODO: Suggestions for spamming
wallet deposit amounts.

### Prerequisites

1.  You must have a Monero node running locally. It is best to enable
    the restricted RPC port because connections to the unrestricted RPC
    port experience performance problems when the txpool is large. You
    can start your Monero node with the standard testnet restricted RPC
    port by adding `--rpc-restricted-bind-port=28089` the flag in your
    `monerod` startup command. If you prefer not to enable the
    restricted RPC port, the *unrestricted* RPC port for testnet at
    28081 is available by default to connections from within your local
    machine. For a smooth connection experience, also add
    `--rpc-max-connections=1000`,
    `--rpc-max-connections-per-public-ip=1000` and
    `--rpc-max-connections-per-private-ip=1000` as startup flags.

2.  You should have a wallet with some testnet XMR. You will send coins
    from this wallet to the spamming wallets.

3.  You must create a new empty working directory. Place the correct
    version of `monero-wallet-rpc` into the working directory.

Starting with a small-scale test wallet can help familiarize users with
the process and discover bugs early.

### Small-scale test

Start a new R instance in a terminal in the working directory. Use
`screen` or another similar program to prevent losing the instance. Once
you have installed `xmrspammer`, load the package into the workspace:

``` r
library(xmrspammer)
```

You must specify the `monerod` RPC port and the number of spamming
wallets to be created. In this example we will assume that you have the
node’s restricted RPC port available at 28089. We will create one wallet
for this test.

``` r
wallets <- gen.wallets(monerod.rpc.port = 28089, n.wallets = 1)
```

A single `monero-wallet-rpc` process should have launched to manage the
single wallet we created. Check that the process is alive:

``` r
wallets[[1]]$monero_wallet_rpc_process$is_alive()
```

The console should print `TRUE`.

Next, we will fund the spamming wallet.
[`fund.wallets()`](https://rucknium.github.io/xmrspammer/reference/fund.wallets.md)
is a convenience function that will print the exact command to input
into the `monero-wallet-cli` of the funding wallet. Input the `amount`
argument to specify the total amount of XMR you will send to the
spamming wallet(s).

``` r
fund.wallets(wallets, amount = 30)
```

R will print a statement like

``` txt
transfer priority <address> 30 subtractfeefrom=all
```

Input the statement into `monero-wallet-cli` and confirm broadcast of
the transaction. You will have to wait 10 blocks or about 20 minutes for
the outputs of the transaction to be spendable for the next step.

Now we will create the account leaves of the wallet. This test wallet
will use three levels of 15-output transactions. The process will create
`15^3 = 3375` leaf accounts. Fee priority will be set to 4 for each
level. There are four standard fee tiers: 1, 2, 3, and 4. When the
txpool is full, a low-fee transaction could take a long time to confirm,
slowing down this step in the process. We will choose fee priority 4 for
all tree levels so that the accounts are built as quickly as possible.

``` r
wallets <- prep.leaves.wallets(wallets, n.outputs = 15,
  n.tree.levels = 3, fee.priority = c(4, 4, 4))
```

These transactions should take about 60 minutes (30 blocks) to become
spendable.

Finally, start the spamming. The next line will initiate an infinite
loop. Input `ctrl + c` to interrupt the spamming loop if desired.

``` r
spam.1in.2out.wallets(wallets)
```

You can check the status of the spamming wallets by starting a new R
session in a different terminal window (or a different `screen`
session). You must start the R session in the working directory where
you started the original R session. It should have some files and
subdirectories by now. Remember to load the package into the workspace:

``` r
library(xmrspammer)
```

Now load the wallet data into the workspace:

``` r
wallets <- readRDS("spam_wallets_data.rds")
```

Get some status information about the wallet:

``` r
wallets.status(wallets, get_balance = TRUE)
```

Ignore the message about the RPC process being dead. You may see log
messages about insufficient funds for creating new transactions. When
the txpool is large, there will be many transactions in the queue in
front of yours, so you may have all of your accounts with transactions
waiting in the txpool.

### Large-scale use

TODO

### Revive wallets

You may need to close the R session you used to generate the wallets
and/or shut down your machine. Or one or more `monero-wallet-rpc`
processes may have spontaneously quit. The
[`revive.wallets()`](https://rucknium.github.io/xmrspammer/reference/revive.wallets.md)
function can bring the wallets back under your control in a new R
session.

First, make sure that no other R sessions with the wallets are open.

Open a new R session in the directory where the wallet files are
located. Load the package:

``` r
library(xmrspammer)
```

Then use the
[`revive.wallets()`](https://rucknium.github.io/xmrspammer/reference/revive.wallets.md)
function to gain control of the wallets:

``` r
wallets <- revive.wallets(monerod.rpc.port = 28089)
```

If `28089` is not your `monerod`’s RPC port, change it.

You can check the wallet status:

``` r
wallets.status(wallets, get_balance = TRUE)
```

And start spamming again:

``` r
spam.1in.2out.wallets(wallets)
```

[`revive.wallets()`](https://rucknium.github.io/xmrspammer/reference/revive.wallets.md)
will launch new `monero-wallet-rpc` processes if the ones you launched
before had quit. By default,
[`revive.wallets()`](https://rucknium.github.io/xmrspammer/reference/revive.wallets.md)
will just connect to an existing `monero-wallet-rpc` process if one is
already running. To quit all `monero-wallet-rpc` processes and restart a
fresh `monero-wallet-rpc` process for every wallet, input this:

``` r
wallets <- revive.wallets(monerod.rpc.port = 28089,
  restart.alive.processes = TRUE)
```
